# Introduction #
Many times, in many projects, we need internationalize labels and texts.
Commonly we localize the keys of the main language, or our natural language.
After time, we start translation with other language. And after time we add
a new key in main language, and we forgot translate the another, and again we need translate.
As development progress, the files become desynchronized, and we hear,
"this file don't have these key", "this key is not translated",or something else.

# Objective #
The goal of the plugin is to provide an editor where we can review and modify
all resource files at once and get a glimpse of the texts for all languages
that we need translate to our application.
